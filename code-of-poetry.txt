It is said, "Code is poetry."
Just as much, poetry is code!
Indeed, poetry is the code of humanity;
The human code thus programs ideology.

We dance & sing
To express most everything.
We write and read
Thus knowing our deeds.

Humankind moves and thinks
With whatever be put in ink.
Books change worlds
As hearts chase words.

Written code indexes, colors & fills
Design, screen & platform,
But psalter shall alter what wills
And always deem without quorum.

Ideas encoded in a language
Of the heart, wordless and timeless,
Aluded and indicated,
But incomprehensible and undefinable.

Yes, let it be said
that code is a poem.
Yet, let it be known
the poem, too, is a code.
